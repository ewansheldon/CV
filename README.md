## Ewan Sheldon

I am a **full-stack junior developer** and have recently graduated from Makers Academy, Europe's leading software development bootcamp. Despite having an interest throughout university in coding and development, I didn't think it would be possible to convert this into a professional skill.

However, having spent an intense 16 weeks at Makers learning how to pick up any new tech efficiently, and nailing the best practices of software development processes, I am now well equipped to further my learning in a junior developer role. Though I understand that I still have much to learn as a developer, I know that I have a unique set of skills that will prove useful to any team, and I am looking for a development team that will give me the support that I need to prove this.

## Skills

#### Quick to learn and adapt

Beyond all else, it is my tendency to put myself into unfamiliar situations and find my feet quickly that gives me great potential as a developer.

In my first full-time job after university, I was granted the responsibility to create and lead the social media team for Deliveroo, at a time when the company was rapidly transitioning from an exciting startup into a globally recognised food delivery company. Having no real experience in social media, it was a daunting task but I am proud that I was able to create the template for a team that now exists globally in each of Deliveroo's international departments. That I was able to move from learning the ropes to being able to consult internationally is testament to my ability to adapt and thrive.

In my third year of university, I was lucky enough to study at Madrid's largest university. To push my language skills to the limit, I enrolled on politics, literature and history modules with native speakers, forcing me out of my comfort zone and putting my pigeon Spanish under the microscope. Later in the year I moved to Moscow having only studied for two years and never visited Russia previously. I moved into a small room in a Russian grandma's house. Her blunt manner with her lodgers and no ability to speak English again meant it was sink or swim for my language skills, but suffice to say we made it work.

I further pushed myself out of my comfort zone while studying at Makers Academy. During each group project that we undertook, my groups prioritised learning new technologies. In our first group project week, and with only five days practice with Javascript previously, we developed a full stack Airbnb clone with Express in four days. During our hackathon we developed an atom plug-in to push TDD with no prior knowledge of working with the domain. For our final project we challenged ourselves with a brand new language and project workspace by developing an iOS app. This proved the greatest challenge, and we were still getting to grips with the language all the way to the end, but we were extremely proud of the product that we were able to present at our graduation.

#### Projects

Project | Description | Technologies | Testing | Timeframe
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
[Attendr](https://github.com/ewansheldon/attendr) | An iOS dating app that allows users to 'like' events that they're interested in, and only connects users interested in the same events as potential matches. We also created a separate [Node server project](https://github.com/ewansheldon/attendr-server) to push events we wanted to the app and store user information. The app has a chat function integrated, built with Firebase, to allow users to get to know each other before their date. | Swift, Javascript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Firebase | Jasmine | 8 Days
[TDDetective](https://github.com/tam-borine/TDDetective) | During a three-day hackathon, we were tasked with creating a tool for developers. As ardent believers in the benefits of TDD, we produced an atom package to detect any code written without a test to support it. Our package highlights in red any untested Ruby classes or methods. | Javascript, Node.js | Jasmine | 3 Days
[AirBnBird](https://github.com/mjosephmiller/makersbnb) | A full stack Airbnb clone built with technologies that were completely unfamiliar to us as a group. Having previously worked mostly with Ruby, we saw this as a great opportunity to further our JS knowledge. | JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, Sequelize | Mocha, Chai, Zombie | 4 Days
