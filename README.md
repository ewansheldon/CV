## Ewan Sheldon

I am a **full-stack junior developer** and have recently graduated from Makers Academy, Europe's leading software development bootcamp. I have mainly worked with Ruby, Javascript and Swift, but have proven ability to build projects with brand new technologies within days. I am a fast learner and keen problem-solver with great attention to detail. Though I understand that I still have much to learn as a developer, I know that I have a unique set of skills that will prove useful to any team, and I am looking for a development team with strong direction, vision and culture that will give me the support that I need to prove this.

Feeling unchallenged and frustrated with the digital marketing work I was doing after university, a friend persuaded me of the power of the Makers Academy process. Having a keen interest in tech after working closely with the Product team at my previous job, and with little to lose, I was excited by the challenge. Now, with an intense 16 weeks at Makers behind learning how to pick up any new tech efficiently, and nailing the best practices of software development processes, I am well equipped to further my learning in a junior developer role. I am excited to work in an industry whose ever-changing nature will keep me on my toes everyday.

## Skills

#### Quick to learn and adapt

Beyond all else, it is my tendency to put myself into unfamiliar situations and find my feet quickly that gives me great potential as a developer.

I certainly pushed myself out of my comfort zone while studying at Makers Academy. During each group project that we undertook, my groups prioritised learning new technologies:

- Full-stack Express Airbnb replica with a few days of Javascript previous
- Atom package with no knowledge of the domain during a high-stakes hackathon
- iOS app final project with no experience of Swift of Xcode

I now feel very confident and proud in my ability to work with unfamiliar technology.

Fortunate enough to be granted the responsibility to create and lead the social media team for Deliveroo, at a time when the company was rapidly transitioning from an exciting startup into a globally recognised food delivery company, and having no real experience in digital marketing, it was a daunting task but I am proud that I was able to create the template for a team that now exists globally in each of Deliveroo's international departments. That I was able to move from learning the ropes to being able to consult internationally is testament to my ability to adapt and thrive.

I enrolled on politics, literature and history modules with native speakers while studying in Madrid and in Moscow I lived alone with a brusque old Russian lady. Both experiences in their own way pushed my language skills to the limit and I believe they shaped my ability to succeed in unfamiliar tech surroundings now.

#### Communication

Regular and effective communication is crucial for any efficient team of developers, and I therefore made this a constant focus throughout my time studying at Makers Academy:

- Daily pair-programming
- Daily standups
- Weekly retrospectives

These practices now allow me to feel confident in my ability to explain and listen to technical problems and solutions.

At Deliveroo I would be in constant communication with higher-ups and other departments while my new department was integrated into the company. I was also regularly training members of my team and consulting international branches of the company.

I owe my communication skills to my modern languages degree, during which expressing myself and understanding other was unfortunately not so easy.

## Projects

Project | Description | Technologies | Testing | Timeframe
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
[Attendr](https://github.com/ewansheldon/attendr) | An iOS dating app that allows users to 'like' events that they're interested in, and only connects users interested in the same events as potential matches. We also created a [RESTful API](https://github.com/ewansheldon/attendr-server) to push events we wanted to the app and store user information. The app has a chat function integrated, built with Firebase, to allow users to get to know each other before their date. | Swift, Javascript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Firebase | Jasmine | 8 Days
[TDDetective](https://github.com/tam-borine/TDDetective) | During a three-day hackathon, we were tasked with creating a tool for developers. As ardent believers in the benefits of TDD, we produced an atom package to detect any code written without a test to support it. Our package highlights in red any untested Ruby classes or methods. | Javascript, Node.js | Jasmine | 3 Days
[AirBnBird](https://github.com/ewansheldon/makers-bnb) | A full stack Airbnb clone built with technologies that were completely unfamiliar to us as a group. Having previously worked mostly with Ruby, we saw this as a great opportunity to further our JS knowledge. | JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, Sequelize | Mocha, Chai, Zombie | 4 Days

## Other Interests

When I'm taking a rare moment away from debugging or refactoring, I like to dive into the filmographies of Stanley Kubrick, Wes Anderson and David Lynch, listen to some avant-garde Brooklyn-based art rock or perhaps relax with an episode of The Simpsons (strictly seasons 1-10). I can also regularly be found watching Arsenal in agony on weekends.
